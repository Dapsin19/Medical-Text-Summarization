# Project 4: Medical Text Summarization

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to design optimized prompts that guide an AI model to quickly and accurately summarize patient case notes for doctors.

## Problem Statement

The task is to create prompts that ensure the AI can generate clear, concise, and accurate medical summaries while maintaining patient confidentiality.

## Solution Approach

* Design clear, role-based prompts for medical text summarization.
* Emphasize clarity, brevity, and patient confidentiality.
* Ensure that the AI only summarizes the provided text without adding information.
* Regularly refine the prompts for better summarization quality.

## Prompt Example

"You are a highly trained medical text summarizer. Your task is to read and summarize patient case notes accurately and concisely. Ensure that the summaries are clear, preserve all critical medical information, and maintain strict patient confidentiality. Avoid adding information not present in the original text."

## Example Scenarios

### Detailed Case Notes

**Original Text:** "Patient A is a 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension and diabetes, presenting with chest pain and shortness of breath. Physical examination reveals elevated blood pressure and irregular heartbeat."

**AI Summary:** "55-year-old male with hypertension and diabetes presents with chest pain and shortness of breath. Physical exam shows high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat."

### Brief Case Notes

**Original Text:** "Patient B, 30, reports a mild headache after a recent fall. No loss of consciousness."

**AI Summary:** "30-year-old patient with a mild headache after a fall. No loss of consciousness."
